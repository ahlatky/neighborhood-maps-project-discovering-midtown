# Neighborhood Map Project: Discovering Midtown-Reno

## Objective / Purpose

**My Neighborhood Map Project** is an application that runs in order to help users discover Midtown-Reno in Reno, NV--an up and coming part of the Reno, NV area with cool, eclectic shops, dining, and more.

## Documentation 

In this project, I used Google Maps API to generate the map on the user interface (UI) and also Foursquare API in order to generate Foursquare 'check-in' information for my featured 'Top Places' in order to further convey the popularity of my suggested places to visit in Midtown.

## Install
